# n34

A CLI to interact with NIP-34 and other stuff related to code in Nostr

## About

`n34` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for sending and receiving Git
issues, patches, and comments over the Nostr protocol. It supports creating,
replying to, and managing issues and patches, making Git collaboration
decentralized and censorship-resistant.

The primary goal of `n34` is to implement [NIP-34] (`git` stuff), but its
flexible design allows for additional use cases beyond Git workflows. For more
details, see the following section.

## Why Nostr?

Nostr is fundamentally different from traditional platforms because it’s not
an application or service, it’s a decentralized protocol. This means any tool or
app can integrate with it, enabling open, permissionless collaboration without
relying on centralized gatekeepers. Unlike proprietary systems, Nostr doesn’t
require emails, passwords, or accounts. You interact directly through relays,
whether you self-host your own or use public ones, ensuring no single point of
failure or control.

What makes Nostr uniquely resilient is its design, the protocol itself is just
a set of rules, not a company or product that can disappear. Your Git issues,
patches, and comments persist as long as relays choose to store them, immune to
the whims of corporate shutdowns or policy changes. Nostr is infrastructure in
its purest form, an idea that outlives any temporary implementation. `n34` taps
into a future-proof foundation for decentralized collaboration.
