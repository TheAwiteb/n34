## Contribution Workflow

Before submitting changes, open an issue to discuss your proposed contribution.
Clearly indicate that you intend to work on it and wait for a maintainer's
response. If the issue remains open, you may proceed with submitting your patch.

### Reporting Issues

When opening an issue, include:
- Detailed steps to reproduce the problem
- Relevant error messages or logs (use the `-vvvv` flag for verbose output)
- Expected vs. actual behavior

Please label your issue appropriately (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `question`) to
help categorize it.

### Your Patch

Ensure your patch submission tool notifies the maintainers and sends the patch
to their read relays, most tools handle this automatically.

#### Patch Guidelines

- Keep patches small: Focused changes are easier to review and merge.
- Run `just ci` before submitting your patch.
- Update the change log with your patch. Run `just changelog` or `git-cliff > CHANGELOG.md`
- Add your name to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file if this is your first contribution. (alphabetical order)
- Use [Conventional Commits]: Start the patch subject with one of these types:
  - `feat`: New feature
  - `fix`: Bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation updates
  - `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavioral changes
  - `deprecate`: Marking code as deprecated
  - `remove`: Removing deprecated code
  - `security`: Security-related changes
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Test additions or corrections
- For all other changes, use `chore`.
- Add `!` to the subject if your patch contains a breacking change, e.g.
`remove!: text` and `fix(reply)!: text`
- Use the `--cover-letter` flag to include a cover letter with your patch. Describe the issue you’re addressing, whether it’s a one-line bug fix or a 5000-line new feature.
- Specify the base commit for your patch using the `--base` flag.
- First-time contributors: Review the [Submitting Patches guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html) before sending your patch.

#### Code Style

When writing code, make sure to folow this:
- Using Rust's official formatting tool, `rustfmt`, to format your code.
- Writing clear and concise code with meaningful variable and function names.
- Adding comments to explain complex logic or algorithms.

#### Cover Letter Description

Your patch description should provide a clear and concise summary of the changes you
have made. It should also include any relevant context or background information
that will help the project maintainers understand the purpose of the changes.
Make sure to reference the issue[^1] that your patch is addressing, and note any breaking
changes that your patch introduces.



[^1]: When referencing, avoid URLs or `nevent` formats with relays. Instead, use only the note ID in `note1` bech32 format.
