# This file contains NIP-19 `naddr` entities for repositories that accept this
# project's issues and patches.
#
# The file acts as a **read-only reference** for retrieving repository relays
# when embedded in an `naddr` and mentions those repositories when opening
# patches or issues. Modifications here will not affect in the relays, as the
# file is **explicitly untracked**. Its goal is to simplify contributions by
# removing the need for manual address entry.
#
# Each entry must start with "naddr". Embedded relays are **strongly recommended**
# to assist client-side discovery.
#
# Empty lines are ignored. Lines starting with "#" are treated as comments.
