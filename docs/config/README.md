# Manage Configuration

Configuration allows you to set default values for various command parameters,
such as fallback relays, Proof of Work (PoW) difficulty, a default bunker URL,
and your Nostr private key (keyring). This avoids the need to enter your private key,
bunker URL, relays, or PoW difficulty for every command, making `n34` more
convenient to use.
