```

This command generates an announcement event to publish your project. It can be
used to announce a new repository or update an existing one.

When updating, you must resubmit all repository fields, not just the fields
you wish to change. The command uses this information to build and publish a
completely new announcement event that will replace the old one.

It is recommended to use the `--address-file` flag. This option creates
a `nostr-address` file that enables `n34` to automatically discover the
repository's address, simplifying the workflow for contributors.
