  -e, --editor                     Opens the user's default editor to write issue content. The first line will be used as the issue subject
      --subject <SUBJECT>          The issue subject. Cannot be used together with the `--editor` flag

Use the `n34 issue new` command to create a new issue in a repository. This
command supports the [NIP-21] (`nostr:` URI scheme) and hashtags within the
issue content. When you mention public keys in the content, they will be
included in the event tags. Additionally, using hashtags like `#bug` in the
issue body will automatically apply them as labels.

You must choose between the `--content` and `--editor` options. With
`--content`, you provide the issue content directly in the command. With
`--editor`, your default `$EDITOR` will open, allowing you to write the issue
content. The first line of the editor's output will be used as the issue
subject.
